A simple bot that can query data about confirmed, death and recovered cases regarding covid-19. 

* ### **Running the code in your own bot**
    * ``Make a .env file and place it in root``
    * ``The file should have 2 values: token and prefix``
    
* ### **Alternativelly you can run the same piece of code without a discord bot**
    * Go to the root directory of the code and run ``npm run cv`` in your console. The usage is the same with the bot command.
